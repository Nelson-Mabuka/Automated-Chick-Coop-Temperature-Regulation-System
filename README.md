# Automated-Chick-Coop-Temperature-Regulation-System using C++ and Arduino technology
This system regulates the temperature in the chick coop by using predefined temperature thresholds.
The current temperature status is indicated by red, green, and yellow bulbs!
The system responds dynamically to temperature changes, helping farmers to prevent overheating or cold stress, which ensures the well-being of the chicks.
Additionally, an integrated feedback mechanism enhances the efficiency of temperature regulation within the chick coop, making it even more effective
